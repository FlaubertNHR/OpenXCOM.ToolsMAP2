- add UFO1A (small scout) to the default MapTilesets.YML ... note to those who want access to the small scout but don't want to bork their current MapTilesets config: generate a MapTilesets.TPL via the Configurator and copy **type:UFO1A** to their working MapTilesets.YML
- issue a warning if the quantity of allocated Terrain MCD-records exceeds 256. The warning, if applicable, is shown when the Map loads by selecting it in the MapTree or when a Map's descriptor is modified causing the Map to reload (eg. terrains have been added or removed)
