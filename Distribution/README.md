MapView stores settings in a subfolder of itself. If you do not have user-permissions to write to that folder - eg. Program Files - you may have to either enable them or install MapView to a different hierarchy on your hardrive - eg. C:\\

note for Mono users: MapView needs to run once and then be restarted for its window to resize properly.

- see Important note @2019 January 27
- MainView, TopView, RouteView Options to highlight every 10th gridline
- print current selection size x/y in statusbar of MainView
- add to RouteView Edit: node up 1 level/node down 1 level
- a Mapfile save will not write an assigned tilepart if its value exceeds ID #253
- load tileset-configs from MapTilesets.yml even if the game-type (UFO/TFTD) does not have its resources configured
- maintain tileset-configs in MapTilesets.yml even if the game-type (UFO/TFTD) is not configured
- flag RoutesChanged if routes changed when resizing a Map
- ConfigConverter: ver.2, see its ReadMe.txt

- IMPORTANT: Major change to Tileset configuration code. This is a good time to backup all resources (/MAPS, /ROUTES, /TERRAIN) as well as settings/MapResources.yml and settings/MapTilesets.yml. Your current configuration ought still work w/out any changes. But code has been added that supports terrains that are in different folders for a Map. This required general changes across the codebase -- so backup or risk Schr√∂dinger's wrath.
- add warning on startup if UFO/TFTD resource-paths have been disabled in MapResources.yml but there are groups configured for UFO/TFTD in MapTilesets.yml since saving the MapTree would delete those groups
- fix potential inability to exit the TilesetEditor when a tileset has been created but user then wants to cancel it
- case insensitive search for available terrain files
- assign null-tileparts if MCD-records exceed 256 (on Save Mapfile)
- etc

- option to workaround the transparency issue in Mono
- options to set the selection border's color and width
- verify terrains even when Canceling the TilesetEditor
- reposition a couple of toolbar buttons
- provide more information when a Map's MCD records exceeds 256
- use PNG format for inputting/outputting sprites in PckView
- support terrain/unit/bigobs sprites in PckView (but only if they have a .Tab file)

[MapView2_190107b.7z](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DJ3sCI-izA3N4SFH_xJ4LaFWCo8DWUuw/view?usp=sharing)

- add UFO1A (small scout) to the default MapTilesets.YML ... note to those who want access to the small scout but don't want to bork their current MapTilesets config: generate a MapTilesets.TPL via the Configurator and copy **type:UFO1A** to their working MapTilesets.YML
- issue a warning if the quantity of allocated Terrain MCD-records exceeds 256. The warning, if applicable, is shown when the Map loads by selecting it in the MapTree or when a Map's descriptor is modified causing the Map to reload (eg. terrains have been added or removed)
