# MapView II

based on the original MapView by Ben Ratzlaff, but reworked from top to bottom (almost)

Compiled .exe(s) and .dll(s) and a CHM helpfile are in the Distribution folder. I have only a Windows7 64-bit machine, so these files work only under Windows and have been forced to 32-bit builds.

.NET 3.5 is required.

Note that PckView is unable to save PCK files ... at present it is only a viewer.
