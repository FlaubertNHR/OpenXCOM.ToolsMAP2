		<h2>TileView</h2>
		<img src="../png/tileview.png" />

		<p>The viewer panel shows all the tileparts that are currently available for placement in the currently loaded Map.</p>

		<p>The five tabs along the top show pages that contain the tileparts according to their types.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All - shows all types available<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Floors - shows only floor parts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;West Walls - shows only the westwall parts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;North Walls - shows only the northwall parts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Content - shows only the content-type parts</p>

		<p>The background color of the tileparts indicates the special property that each particular part has. A reference for what the colors relate to is available under MainView's Help. The special property is a characteristic of each tilepart's MCD record.</p>

		<p>Left-click or right-click on a tilepart to select it for placement in TopView or MainView. Notice that when a part is selected, the background color of the type-panel that's along the bottom of TopView changes to indicate the currently selected tilepart type. And while it is allowed to place parts of one type into slots that are meant for a different type, Maps that do so may well screw up aspects of XCOM's battlefield mechanics, blast propagation for example. So best practice is to use parts of a type only in the type-slot of their type.</p>

		<p>Double left-click on a tilepart to start PckView with the spriteset containing the currently selected tile loaded.</p>

		<p>Double right-click on a tilepart to open/close a readonly display of the currently selected tilepart's MCD record.</p>

		<p>The titlebar of the viewer shows the currently selected tilepart's MapId, which is its position in the array of all terrains used by the current Map, and its McdId, which is its position in its own terrain, along with the label of the MCD file that contains its record.</p>

		<br>
		<p>The menus along the top of the viewer access</p>

		<h3>PCK menu</h3>

		<p>Open spriteset in PckView - starts PckView with the spriteset containing the currently selected tile loaded. A valid tilepart must be selected first, not the eraser.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>MCD menu</h3>

		<p>Tilepart Information - opens a readonly display of the currently selected tilepart's MCD record.</p>

		<p>Volutar MCD Editor - starts an external application of your choice, the path to which can be specified in TileView's Options.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Edit menu</h3>

		<p>Options - opens the Options for TileView. Descriptions for the entries appear at the bottom of that window.</p>
