		<h2>TileView</h2>
		<img src="../png/tileview.png" />

		<p>The viewer panel shows all the tileparts that are available for placement in the currently loaded tileset's terrainset.</p>

		<p>The five tabs along the top show pages that contain the tileparts according to their types.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All - shows all parts available<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floors - shows only floor parts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;West Walls - shows only the westwall parts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Walls - shows only the northwall parts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content - shows only the content-type parts</p>

		<p>The background color of the tileparts indicates the special property that each particular part has. A reference for what the colors relate to is available under MainView's Help menu. The special property is a characteristic of each tilepart's MCD record.</p>

		<p>Left-click on a tilepart to select it for placement in the tileparts-panel of TopView, or to use the part with the Fill operation of TopView or MainView. Notice that when a part is selected, the background color of the parttype-panel - along the bottom of TopView - changes to indicate the currently selected tilepart type. And, although it is allowed to place parts of one type into slots that are meant for a different type, Maps that do so may well screw up aspects of XCOM's battlefield mechanics - blast propagation, for example. So best practice is to use parts of a type only in the parttype-slot of their type.</p>

		<p>Right-click on a tilepart to select it and display a contextmenu of available operations.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open in PckView [F9] - opens PckView with the spriteset of the currently selected tile loaded and selected. A valid tilepart must be selected other than the eraser. Note that if changes are made and saved in PckView, MapView may need to reload terrains although it will ask for confirmation first; so it's a good idea to save any changes to a Mapfile and its Routes before invoking PckView.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open in McdView [F10] - opens McdView with the recordset of the currently selected tile loaded and selected. A valid tilepart must be selected other than the eraser. Note that if changes are made and saved in McdView, MapView may need to reload terrains although it will ask for confirmation first; so it's a good idea to save any changes to a Mapfile and its Routes before invoking McdView.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tilepart Info [i] - opens and closes MCD Info, a readonly display of the currently selected tilepart's ecord.</p>

		<p>Double left-click on a tilepart or press [i] to view basic MCD Info of the currently selected tilepart.</p>

		<p>The titlebar of the viewer shows the label of the MCD file that contains the tilepart's record, and its terrain ID, which is its position in its terrain list, along with the currently selected tilepart's terrainset ID, which is its position in the array of all terrains used by the current Map.</p>

		<p>[F5] closes TileView.<br>
		[F6] toggles TopView.<br>
		[F7] toggles RouteView.<br>
		[F8] toggles TopRouteView.</p>

		<p>[Ctrl+F5] through [Ctrl+F8] focuses the respective viewer.</p>

		<p>[F11] minimizes all viewers.<br>
		[F12] restores all viewers.</p>
