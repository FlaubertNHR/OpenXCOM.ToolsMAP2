		<h2>Requirements</h2>
		<p>Windows 32 or 64 bit OS. .NET 3.5</p>
		<p>~1 mb diskspace plus a few megs of RAM</p>
		<p>note that .NET will inflate RAM usage exponentially.</p>
		<p>An installation of either XCOM UFO or TFTD. The only files that are absolutely required from the stock game is the CURSOR.PCK/TAB. Configuring MapView to work on your system will be disallowed if those files are not found in the UFOGRAPH subfolder. Other than that, it's certainly handy to have all the stock Maps, Routes, and Terrains - a default tileset configuration is supplied to display them in MapView.</p>
		<p>Maps can be created from scratch, however, with only the cursor-sprite available. But you'd still need to create your own PCKs, TABs, and perhaps MCDs if you don't have the stock resources.</p>
