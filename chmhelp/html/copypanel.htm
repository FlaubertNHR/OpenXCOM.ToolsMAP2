		<h2>CopyPanel</h2>
<!--	<img src="../png/mcdview.png" /> -->

		<p>The CopyPanel is opened by McdView Edit|Open copy panel ....</p>

		<p>And MCD file - either the same or different than the one in McdView's main screen - can be opened on the side in the CopyPanel. The records in this file cannot be altered; it is used only for copying and/or inserting records into the main viewer's recordset. Navigating and selecting tileparts is done the same as in the main viewer, but the right-click contextmenu popup has different operations.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insert after last [Ctrl+i] - inserts the currently selected part or range of selected parts to the end of the recordset in the main viewer. This is the only operation that adds sprites to the main spriteset as well as any referenced Death and Alternate parts along with their sprites: that is, the main terrain's PCK + TAB files will be changed as well as its MCD file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy for insertion [Ctrl+c] - copies the currently selected part or range of selected parts if applicable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;select all [Ctrl+a] - selects all parts in the collection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deselect all [Esc] - deselects any selected parts in the collection as long as an integer field is not currently focused.</p>
