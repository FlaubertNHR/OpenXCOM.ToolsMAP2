		<h2>CopyPanel</h2>
		<img src="../png/copypanel.png" />

		<p>The CopyPanel is opened by McdView Edit|Open copy panel ....</p>

		<p>An MCD file - either the same or different than the one in McdView's main screen - can be opened in the CopyPanel. The records cannot be altered; it is used for inserting records plus their sprites into the main viewer's terrainset. Navigating and selecting tileparts is the same as the main viewer, but a right-click contextmenu popup has different operations.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;insert after last [Ctrl+i] - inserts the currently selected part or range of selected parts to the end of the recordset in the main viewer. This is the only operation of McdView that adds sprites to the main spriteset along with any referenced Death and Alternate parts and their sprites: that is, the main terrain's PCK + TAB files will be changed in addition to its MCD file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy for insertion [Ctrl+c] - copies the currently selected part or range of selected parts if applicable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;select all [Ctrl+a] - selects all parts in the collection.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deselect all [Esc] - deselects any selected parts in the collection as long as an integer field is not currently focused.</p>

		<p>To the bottom left of the CopyPanel are three options for an InsertAfterLast operation.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy Sprites - inserts selected parts' sprites to the main viewer's spriteset.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy Death parts - inserts selected parts' death-parts to the main viewer's recordset.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;copy Alternate parts - inserts selected parts' alternate-parts to the main viewer's recordset.</p>
