		<p>On the left is the Map Tree. This is where tilesets are listed. The toplevel branch is the Group, under that is the Category, and under that are the Tilesets.</p>
		<p>The Group's label must start with either "ufo" or "tftd" (case insensitive). This determines the palette and the default basepath for all tilesets in that group.</p>
		<p>The Category can be labelled whatever.</p>
		<p>The Tileset is what gets displayed in the viewer panel. It appears very much like what is seen during gameplay.</p>
		<p>Left-click selects a branch, and a right-click opens a context menu that allows the selected branch to be edited. Groups and Categories can be created, re-labeled, or deleted. Tilesets can be created or modified with the Tileset Editor. They can also be deleted.</p>
		<p>Above the viewer panel are buttons for<br>
		- zoomin<br>
		- zoomout<br>
		- autozoom<br>
		- level up [mousewheel up]<br>
		- level down [mousewheel down]<br>
		- cut a selected area [Ctrl+X]<br>
		- copy a selected area [Ctrl+C]<br>
		- paste at a selected tile [Ctrl+V]<br>
		- fill a selected area with the currently selected tilepart</p>
		<p>The [Delete] key will delete a selected area.</p>
		<p>The statusbar below the viewer panel shows<br>
		- the current scale factor of the tileset graphic<br>
		- the label of the current tileset<br>
		- the dimensions (x,y,z or column,row,level) of the current tileset<br>
		- the currently selected tile position</p>
		<p>The basepath of the currently displayed tileset is shown in the window's titlebar.</p>
		<p>In the viewer panel, a left-click selects a tile, and a left-click drag motion will select multiple tiles over a rectangular area.</p>
		<p>Autozoom turns off when zoomin or zoomout are used.</p>
		<p>The top of the map, north, is to the upper right direction.</p>
