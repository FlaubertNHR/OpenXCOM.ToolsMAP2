		<img src="../png/topview.png" />

		<p>The top of the panel displays a 2-dimensional representation of the currently loaded Map at the current editing level. Using the mousewheel when the panel is focused raises and lowers the editing level.</p>

		<p>Left of the viewer panel are buttons for<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- level up [mousewheel up]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- level down [mousewheel down]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- cut a selected area [Ctrl+x] (respects Disability toggles)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- paste area at a selected tile [Ctrl+v] (respects Disability toggles)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- delete a selected area [Delete] (respects Disability toggles)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- fill a selected area with the currently selected tilepart from TileView [f]</p>

		<p>Please note that pasting copied parts from one Map to a different Map usually requires that the allocated terrains of both Maps be identical.</p>

		<p>Left-click to select a tile to edit, and a left-click drag motion will select multiple tiles over a rectangular area.</p>

		<p>Double left-click selects the tilepart, in TileView, of the currently selected quadrant.</p>

		<p>Right-click places the tilepart that is currently selected in TileView into a quadrant-slot along the bottom of the viewer, respecting both the currently selected tile position and the currently selected quadrant.</p>

		<p>Double right-click clears the tilepart of the currently selected quadrant.</p>

		<p>The bottom of the panel displays the four quadrant-slots into which tileparts may be placed. The currently selected quadrant has a light blue background. A fifth slot displays TileView's currently selected tilepart.</p>

		<p>Left-click a quadrant-slot to select that quadrant for an operation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[1] - Floor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2] - Westwall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[3] - Northwall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[4] - Content</p>

		<p>Double left-click selects the tilepart that's in the currently selected quadrant in TileView [t].</p>

		<p>Right-click places the tilepart that is currently selected in TileView into the quadrant of selected tile(s) [Enter].</p>

		<p>Double right-click clears the quadrant slot of selected tile(s) [Shift+Delete].</p>

		<p>To the right of the four quadrant-slots is a fifth slot that shows TileView's currently selected tilepart. Click on the sprite or press [q] to auto-select its proper quadrant-slot. Right-click the fifth slot to select the eraser.</p>

		<p>The toolstrip buttons have the same functionality as those in MainView.</p>

		<p>The color-blobs that appear on the Map are simplistic representations of the various parts that have been placed onto tiles.</p>

		<p>Note that [Ctrl+s] can be used to save the Map when the center panel has focus.</p>

		<p>[F5] toggles TileView.<br>
		[F6] closes TopView or toggles TopView if TopRouteView is focused.<br>
		[F7] toggles RouteView.<br>
		[F8] closes TopRouteView or toggles TopRouteView if TopView is focused.</p>

		<p>[Ctrl+F5] through [Ctrl+F8] focuses the respective viewer.<br>
		[Shift+F5] through [Shift+F8] focuses MainView.</p>

		<p>[F11] minimizes all viewers.<br>
		[F12] restores all viewers.</p>

		<p>[Esc] focuses the panel. That is, it defocuses any other control. It can also be used to abort a multi-tile selection.</p>

		<h3>Keyboard navigation</h3>

		<p>The numeric keypad - that is, the arrow keys and [Home], [End], [PageUp], [PageDown] - select the tile in the chosen direction. The add and subtract keys on the numeric keypad lower and raise the current level respectively.</p>

		<p>[Shift] can be held down to create a selection area.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Disabled menu</h3>

		<p>These four operations toggle the visibility of the four possible quadrants for TopView and MainView. When a quadrant is disabled, the background color of its slot changes to dark gray. Tileparts of a disabled type will not be visible and will not be considered for the standard edit operations Cut/Paste/Delete. A Copy operation copies all selected tileparts regardless of disability. It's important to note however that such partslots will still be modified by nonstandard edit operations such as rightclick, double rightclick, and Fill both on the panel and in the quadrant-slots below the panel and by the corresponding keyboard shortcuts.</p>

		<p>The visibility settings have no effect when saving a Map file, all parts are saved whether they're currently disabled or not. Note that the visibility of tileparts can also be toggled on and off with the function keys [F1]..[F4].</p>

		<p>Enable all [F9] enables all quadrants.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Test menu</h3>

		<p>test parts in tileslots - checks that the parttype of all parts that are allocated to the current Map are in their proper quadrant-slots: floors in floorslots, westwalls in westwall slots, northwalls in northwall slots, and contents in content slots.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Options [Ctrl+o] - opens and closes the Options for TopView. Descriptions for the entries appear at the bottom of that window.</p>
