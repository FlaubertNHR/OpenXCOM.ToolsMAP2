		<h2>TopView</h2>
		<img src="../png/topview.png" />

		<p>The top of the panel displays a 2-dimensional representation of the currently loaded Map at the current editing level. Using the mousewheel when the panel is focused raises and lowers the editing level.</p>

		<p>Left of the viewer panel are buttons for<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- level up [mousewheel up]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- level down [mousewheel down]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- cut a selected area [Ctrl+X]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- copy a selected area [Ctrl+C]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- paste area at a selected tile [Ctrl+V]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- fill a selected area with the currently selected tilepart from TileView</p>

		<p>The [Delete] key will delete a selected area.</p>

		<p>Left-click to select a tile to edit, and a left-click drag motion will select multiple tiles over a rectangular area.</p>

		<p>Right-click places the currently selected tilepart from TileView into its proper tilepart type-slot along the bottom of the viewer, respecting the clicked tile position on the 2-dimensional grid and the currently selected tilepart-type shown beneath the grid.</p>

		<p>The bottom of the panel displays the four tilepart type-slots into which parts may be placed. The currently selected type-slot has a light blue background.</p>

		<p>Left-click selects that type-slot as ready to have a tilepart assigned to it.</p>

		<p>Double left-click will select the tilepart that's currently in the slot in TileView.</p>

		<p>Right-click places the currently selected tilepart from TileView into the slot.</p>

		<p>Double right-click clears any tilepart that's in the slot.</p>

		<p>The toolstrip buttons have the same functionality as those in MainView.</p>

		<p>Color-blobs that appear on the Map are simplistic representations of the various parts that have been placed on a tile.</p>

		<p>Note that [Ctrl+S] can be used to save the Map when the center panel has focus.</p>

		<p>[F6] closes TopView and [F8] closes TopRouteView.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Visible menu</h3>

		<p>These four entries toggle the visibility of the four possible tilepart types for TopView and MainView. They can be used for quickly checking out the flooring behind a wall, for example. When a type is toggled off, the background color of its slot changes to dark gray - the tileparts are still modifiable however. The visibility settings have no effect when saving a Map file, all parts are saved whether they're currently visible or not. Note that the visibility of tileparts can also be toggled on and off with Function keys 1..4.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Options [Ctrl+O] - opens and closes the Options for TopView. Descriptions for the entries appear at the bottom of that window.</p>
