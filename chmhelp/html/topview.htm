		<h2>TopView</h2>
		<img src="../png/topview.png" />

		<p>The top of the panel displays a 2-dimensional representation of the currently loaded Map at the current editing level. Using the mousewheel when the panel is focused raises and lowers the editing level.</p>

		<p>Left-click to select a tile to edit, and a left-click drag motion will select multiple tiles over a rectangular area.</p>

		<p>Right-click places the currently selected tilepart from TileView into the tilepart type-slot along the bottom of the viewer, respecting the clicked tile position.</p>

		<p>The bottom of the panel displays the four tilepart type-slots into which parts may be placed. The currently selected type-slot has a light blue background.</p>

		<p>Left-click selects that type-slot as ready to have a tilepart placed into it.</p>

		<p>Double left-click will select the tilepart that's currently in the slot in TileView.</p>

		<p>Right-click places the currently selected tilepart from TileView into the slot.</p>

		<p>Double right-click clears any tilepart that's in the slot.</p>

		<p>The toolstrip buttons have the same functionality as those in MainView.</p>

		<p>Color-blobs that appear on the Map are simplistic representations of the various parts that have been placed on a tile.</p>

		<h3>Visible menu</h3>

		<p>These four entries toggle the visibility of the four tilepart types for TopView and MainView. This can be used for quickly checking out the flooring behind a wall, as an example. When a type is toggled off, the background color of its slot turns dark gray - the part in the slot can still be changed however. They have no effect when saving the Map file, all parts are saved whether they've been flagged or not. Note that the visibility of tileparts can be toggled on and off with Function keys 1..4.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Edit menu</h3>

		<p>Options - opens the Options for TopView. Descriptions for the entries appear at the bottom of that window.</p>
