		<h2>TopView</h2>
		<img src="../png/topview.png" />

		<p>The top of the panel displays a 2-dimensional representation of the currently loaded Map at the current editing level. Using the mousewheel when the panel is focused raises and lowers the editing level.</p>

		<p>Left of the viewer panel are buttons for<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- level up [mousewheel up]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- level down [mousewheel down]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- cut a selected area [Ctrl+X] (respects Visibility toggles)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- copy a selected area [Ctrl+C]<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- paste area at a selected tile [Ctrl+V] (respects Visibility toggles)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- delete a selected area [Delete] (respects Visibility toggles)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- fill a selected area with the currently selected tilepart from TileView [F]</p>

		<p>Please note that pasting copied parts from one Map to a different Map usually requires that the allocated terrains of both Maps be identical.</p>

		<p>Left-click to select a tile to edit, and a left-click drag motion will select multiple tiles over a rectangular area.</p>

		<p>Double left-click selects the tilepart, in TileView, of the currently selected parttype.</p>

		<p>Right-click places the currently selected tilepart from TileView into its proper tilepart type-slot along the bottom of the viewer, respecting both the clicked tile position on the grid and the currently selected parttype shown beneath the grid.</p>

		<p>Double right-click clears the tilepart of the currently selected parttype.</p>

		<p>The bottom of the panel displays the four parttype slots into which tileparts may be placed. The currently selected parttype has a light blue background.</p>

		<p>Left-click selects that parttype's slot as ready to have a tilepart assigned to it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[1] - Floor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[2] - Westwall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[3] - Northwall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[4] - Content</p>

		<p>Double left-click will select the tilepart that's currently in the slot in TileView [T].</p>

		<p>Right-click places the currently selected tilepart from TileView into the slot of selected tile(s) [Enter].</p>

		<p>Double right-click clears the parttype slots of selected tile(s) [Shift+Delete].</p>

		<p>To the right of the four parttype slots is a fifth slot that shows TileView's currently selected tilepart. Click on the sprite or press [Q] to auto-select its proper parttype slot.</p>

		<p>The toolstrip buttons have the same functionality as those in MainView.</p>

		<p>The color-blobs that appear on the Map are simplistic representations of the various parts that have been placed on tiles.</p>

		<p>Note that [Ctrl+S] can be used to save the Map when the center panel has focus.</p>

		<p>[F5] toggles TileView.<br>
		[F6] closes TopView or toggles TopView if TopRouteView is focused.<br>
		[F7] toggles RouteView.<br>
		[F8] closes TopRouteView or toggles TopRouteView if TopView is focused.</p>

		<p>[Ctrl+F5] through [Ctrl+F8] focuses the respective viewer.<br>
		[Shift+F5] through [Shift+F8] focuses MainView.</p>

		<p>[F11] minimizes all viewers.<br>
		[F12] restores all viewers.</p>

		<p>[Esc] focuses the panel. That is, it defocuses any other control. It can also be used to abort a multi-tile selection.</p>

		<p>[Ctrl+Q] quits MapView II</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Keyboard navigation</h3>

		<p>The numeric keypad - that is, the arrow keys and [Home], [End], [PageUp], [PageDown] - select the tile in the chosen direction. The add and subtract keys on the numeric keypad lower and raise the current level respectively.</p>

		<p>[Shift] can be held down to create a selection area.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Visible menu</h3>

		<p>These four operations toggle the visibility of the four possible tilepart types for TopView and MainView. They can be used for checking out flooring that's concealed behind a wall, for example. When a type is toggled off, the background color of its slot changes to dark gray - the parts are still modifiable in the parttype slots below the panel, however Cut/Paste/Delete operations consider visible parttypes only. A Copy operation copies all selected tileparts regardless of visibility.</p>

		<p>The visibility settings have no effect when saving a Map file, all parts are saved whether they're currently visible or not. Note that the visibility of tileparts can also be toggled on and off with the function keys F1..F4.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Options [Ctrl+O] - opens and closes the Options for TopView. Descriptions for the entries appear at the bottom of that window.</p>
