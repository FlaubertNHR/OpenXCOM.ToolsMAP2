		<p>The reason for MapView is ...</p>
		<p>... because XCOM is a great game that's played on battlefield maps.</p>
		<p>So there needs to be a MAP editor. ergo: MapView</p>
		<p>The original MapView was created by Ben Ratzlaff aka DaiShiva, and has been subsequently enhanced by several persons.</p>
		<p>MapView II</p>
		<p>is reworked code that maintains almost all of the original design of MapView.</p>
