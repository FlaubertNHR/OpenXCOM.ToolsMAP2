		<p>The reason for MapView is ...</p>
		<p>... because XCOM is a great game that's played on battlefield maps.</p>
		<p>So there needs to be a MAP editor. ergo: MapView</p>
		<p>The original MapView was created by Ben Ratzlaff aka DaiShiva, and has been subsequently enhanced by several persons.</p>
		<p>MapView II</p>
		<p>is reworked code that maintains almost all of the original design of MapView. The most significant change is the means of creating and modifying tileset meta-data. The old Paths Editor is now a simpler Tileset Editor.</p>
		<p>Several bugs have been fixed and many annoyances dehanced. Vast tracts of superfluous code have been deleted and the rest refactored.</p>
		<p>The emphasis of MapView II is user-friendly functionality.</p>
