		<h2>PckView II</h2>
		<img src="../png/pckview.png" />

		<p>PckView is a spriteset editor for XCOM.</p>

		<p>PckView II can load, create, edit, and save PCK+TAB files that contain terrain sprites or unit sprites that are 32x40 8-bpp and bigobs sprites that are 32x48 8-bpp. Note that PCK files must have corresponding TAB files. Loading, editing, and saving SCANG.DAT files is also supported.</p>

		<p>The center panel displays sprites that are currently in the loaded spriteset.</p>

		<p>Left-click selects a sprite.</p>

		<p>Right-click shows a contextmenu based on the currently selected sprite after opening or creating a spriteset.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit - opens the selected sprite in the Sprite Editor. Double-clicking a sprite also brings it up in the editor, as does pressing Enter if a sprite is currently selected.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Add ... - adds a sprite or sprites to the end of the spriteset.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert before ... - inserts a sprite or sprites directly before the selected sprite.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert after ... - inserts a sprite or sprites directly after the selected sprite.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Replace ... - replaces the selected sprite with a different image.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Move left - swaps the selected sprite with the sprite directly before it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Move right - swaps the selected sprite with the sprite directly after it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete - removes the selected sprite from the spriteset.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Export sprite ... - exports the selected sprite to a file in PNG format.</p>

		<p>Adding and inserting sprites requires that their files are of the proper dimensions for the spriteset, 8-bpp images in PNG, GIF, or Windows BMP format.</p>

		<p>The statusbar along the bottom shows the total quantity of sprites in the set, the id of the sprite that is under the mouse-cursor, and the id of the currently selected sprite. The label of the spriteset is also displayed.</p>

		<h3>File menu</h3>

		<p>Open Pck (terrain/unit) file ... - opens a PCK spriteset that contains UFO/TFTD terrain or unit sprites (32x40).</p>
		<p>Open Pck (bigobs) file ... - opens a PCK spriteset that contains UFO/TFTD bigobs sprites (32x48).</p>
		<p>Create Pck file<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Create terrain ... - creates a new PCK spriteset that can contain UFO/TFTD terrain sprites only (32x40).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Create bigobs ... - creates a new PCK spriteset that can contain UFO/TFTD bigobs sprites only (32x48).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Create ufo unit ... - creates a new PCK spriteset that can contain UFO unit sprites only (32x40).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Create tftd unit ... - creates a new PCK spriteset that can contain TFTD unit sprites only (32x40).</p>
		<p>Open ScanG.Dat ... - opens a DAT spriteset that contains ScanG icons (4x4).</p>
		<p>Save - saves the current PCK spriteset.</p>
		<p>Save As ... - saves the current PCK spriteset to another file.</p>
		<p>Export sprites ... - exports all the sprites in the current spriteset to a directory. The images will be in PNG format.</p>
		<p>Export spritesheet ... - exports all the sprites in the current spriteset to a spritesheet in PNG format.</p>
		<p>Import spritesheet ... - replaces the spriteset with an imported spritesheet. Spritesheets can be imported in PNG, GIF, or Windows BMP format.</p>
		<p>Quit - exits the application. <b>THERE IS NO PROMPT TO SAVE ANY CHANGES.</b> This is a bare-bones app that requires prior understanding of how XCOM terrain sprites work and why they work as they do, so please stay on the ball.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Palette menu</h3>

		<p>Shows a list of available palettes. Note that sprites do <b>not</b> contain color information - only <b>256 palette indices</b> are loaded and saved. Hence the currently selected palette makes no difference when saving a spriteset. However, the sprites are displayed in PckView with hard-coded color information, which may or may not make them appear slightly differently than they would while actually playing XCOM.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Transparency menu</h3>

		<p>On/off - toggles whether or not color index #0 is displayed as transparent. This affects only the display in PckView and does <b>not</b> get saved to the spriteset.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Bytes menu</h3>

		<p>Show/hide byte table - opens or closes a window that shows the color-indices of all pixels for the currently selected sprite. It is not editable.</p>

		<br>
		<h3>Help menu</h3>

		<p>About - version information. Also shows the build-type and currently running OS architecture.</p>

		<p>Help - shows this CHM helpfile.</p>
